# LEVA Protocol – Tokenomics Architecture

LEVA is a fixed-supply, non-inflationary execution token that functions as the cryptographic trigger for strategic coordination. Each LEVA token burned initiates a schema-bound agent and generates a structured output — verifiable, versioned, and irreversible. The protocol is designed around action, not speculation: tokens are not staked, yielded, redistributed, or governed. They are consumed through one function only — execution.

---

## 1. Supply

LEVA has a permanently fixed total supply of 100,000,000 tokens.

There is no mint function, no inflation schedule, and no emission rights. The protocol architecture is structured such that token flow is one-directional: from circulating supply to irreversible consumption. Tokens do not circulate between users; they are not transferred to agents, validators, or treasuries. Each token burned represents a permanent reduction in supply and the triggering of a verifiable strategic logic.

---

## 2. Allocation Framework

LEVA’s initial allocation is divided into five high-integrity categories, each mapped to a distinct functional layer of the protocol:

**Public LBP — 10% (10,000,000 LEVA)**  
This constitutes the only public sale of LEVA tokens and will be executed via a Fjord LBP on Base. These tokens are fully circulating, with no vesting or lockup, and form the liquidity foundation for Phase 1: Protocol Ignition. Every token sold enters public hands, not insider wallets.

**Founding Team — 15% (15,000,000 LEVA)**  
Allocated to the protocol’s founding contributors and infrastructure team. These tokens are subject to a 12-month cliff followed by 36-month linear vesting, with no acceleration clauses, backdoors, or early unlocks. Team tokens are fully locked and excluded from any governance exposure or control privileges.

**Ecosystem Incentives — 25% (25,000,000 LEVA)**  
Reserved for schema developers, execution engineers, and infrastructure contributors. These tokens are not pre-allocated; they are released against demonstrable technical contribution validated through registry integration and schema performance metrics. This pool includes UX contributors, schema testers, and third-party composability partners.

**Validator & Agent Network — 20% (20,000,000 LEVA)**  
Allocated to schema validators and agent registry maintainers. These actors perform active protocol functions — enforcing logic boundaries, verifying version integrity, and maintaining schema reliability. Rewards are structured as milestone-based unlocks or validator grants, not yield or emissions.

**Long-Term Treasury Reserve — 30% (30,000,000 LEVA)**  
Time-locked reserve controlled by protocol contracts for future infrastructure expansion, cross-chain deployment, or validator onboarding. This reserve is not liquid at launch and is not tied to operations. There is no treasury management team, no allocation committee, and no spend authorization — these tokens are inert until future composability paths are defined.

---

## 3. Vesting & Lock Terms

All team-held and reserve tokens are subject to strict lock conditions:

The founding team’s allocation is subject to a 12-month cliff followed by 36-month linear vesting. Treasury and validator tokens are programmatically locked and unreleased until protocol maturity triggers are met. There are no early unlocks, token-based advisory deals, or emissions-based incentives embedded in the vesting architecture. All circulating supply at launch originates solely from the LBP allocation.

## 4. Revenue & Value Capture

LEVA introduces a burn-based coordination model. Unlike staking or fee-based systems, value capture does not rely on redistributive mechanics, inflation, or treasury flows. Instead, value accrues through one mechanism: irreversible execution.

Each time a user burns LEVA, they trigger a schema-bound agent that produces a deterministic, auditable output. This output is generated within a controlled schema registry and linked cryptographically to the burn event. The execution path is archived via IPFS and distributed through webhook/email output layers.

There are no protocol fees, validator cuts, or liquidity taxes. The protocol does not collect revenue. All economic value is linked to function: burn to execute. The more coordination occurs, the more supply is reduced. The system gains trust and utility, not speculation.

This model allows downstream builders — schema authors, validator networks, and external automation flows — to integrate LEVA into higher-order workflows. No permissions are needed. No governance overhead is introduced. Protocol usage becomes infrastructure-grade.

---

## 5. Governance Model

LEVA is not a governance token. It introduces no voting rights, proposal mechanics, or stakeholder consensus models. Protocol change does not occur through token-weighted decisions but through schema evolution, validator participation, and forkability.

The execution layer is immutable by design. Agents, once registered, are tied to fixed schemas and logic paths. Any new direction for the protocol must emerge through open development, not internal control.

In this sense, LEVA is anti-fragile. It requires no DAO, no multisig, and no governance coordination. Execution replaces governance.

---

## 6. Structural Guarantees

- LEVA has not raised external capital to date.  
- There are no presales, no private allocations, and no token-based advisory programs.  
- No airdrops are planned or executed.  
- No emissions occur post-launch.  
- Token utility is singular: burn for execution.  
- Protocol operation is non-custodial and irreversible.

## 7. Design Intent

LEVA is designed to disappear.

Its token does not represent future rights, stake, or yield. It represents the cost of irreversible action. Once used, it is gone — burned permanently as a signal of coordination. What remains is the output: a strategic action tied to a registered schema and a timestamped execution record.

This structure enables the protocol to scale without requiring community retention, inflationary incentives, or governance theatre. It enables builders to rely on deterministic logic, not human negotiation.

LEVA is not the centre of the system. Execution is. Every burn advances that principle.
