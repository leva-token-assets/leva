# LEVA Protocol — Tokenomics Architecture (Refined)

---

## Overview

**LEVA** is a fixed-supply, non-inflationary **execution asset** designed to anchor verifiable strategy orchestration. Each LEVA unit consumed triggers a schema-bound agent, generating a versioned, auditable output. The core design principle remains supply finality: tokens are removed from circulation permanently through execution, not speculation.

---

## 1. Supply

**Total Supply:** 100,000,000 LEVA (fixed forever)  
- No mint function  
- No inflation schedule  
- No hidden emissions  
- Once consumed, supply exits permanently

---

## 2. Allocation Framework

Supply is structured across five functional tracks to balance immediate usage, contributor incentives, and ecosystem longevity:

**Public Circulation — 10% (10M LEVA)**  
Allocated for initial market activation and circulating supply. Fully unlocked and non-vesting.

**Founding Team — 15% (15M LEVA)**  
Locked for 12 months, then released linearly over 36 months. No fast-track unlocks, no governance control privileges.

**Ecosystem Pool — 20% (20M LEVA)**  
Allocated for builders, schema developers, UX contributors, and registry maintainers. Released only for validated contributions — milestone-based, performance-tied, no passive farming.

**Staking & Delegation Vault — 20% (20M LEVA)**  
Allocated for staking incentives. This pool provides burn credits, capacity discounts, and delegated execution rights — not idle yield or inflationary drip. When used, staking credits are destroyed with execution.

**Long-Term Reserve — 35% (35M LEVA)**  
Locked for future cross-chain deployments, validator onboarding, or composability extensions. Programmatic unlocks only; no ad hoc treasury spending.

## 3. Burn Mechanics

Every resolved orchestration pathway requires permanent supply exit:
- Each schema-bound agent consumes LEVA to generate an immutable output.
- Burn event triggers a cryptographic record, version tag, and supply update.
- No recirculation: what burns exits supply forever.

---

## 4. Staking & Utility

Holders can stake to gain **structured utility**, not passive emissions:

- **Burn Credits:** Staked positions unlock execution at discounted cost.
- **Delegation:** Staked holders can assign burn credits to portfolio companies, teams, or partner projects.
- **Unlocks:** Access to higher-order agent pathways and testnet modules.
- **No Passive Yield:** Rewards are supply-exit linked; no new units minted.

---

## 5. Value Model

LEVA does not generate treasury fees, hidden royalties, or central redistribution.  
All value flows through *supply finality* — the more orchestration runs, the more supply exits permanently.

Downstream builders and validators integrate directly with the ignition condition. No permission or governance vote required.

---

## 6. Governance Model

LEVA is not a voting token by default.  
- No on-chain DAO with treasury proposals.
- No token-weighted governance for day-to-day upgrades.
- Change emerges through registry validators, schema maintainers, and forks.
- Execution replaces governance — each burn event leaves a final record.

---

## 7. Safeguards

- No private insider rounds or side deals.  
- No advisory emissions.  
- No retroactive unlocks.  
- No airdrops.  
- Once launched, supply moves one way: *burned or staked → consumed.*

---

## 8. Design Intent

LEVA is engineered as **the disappearing trigger**:
- It represents the cost of resolved action — not idle speculation.
- Burn → version → proof → exit supply.
- What remains is the execution: registered, timestamped, verifiable.

No passive holders, no inflation churn — only a finite layer that underwrites real strategy throughput.
