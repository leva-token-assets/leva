## 💰 Tokenomics & Supply FAQs

---

## 🔢 What is the total supply of LEVA?

The total supply of LEVA is **fixed** and **non-inflationary**.  
There is no emissions schedule, no mint function, and no future token unlocks.

---

## 🔥 How much of the supply is allocated to the LBP?

**10%** of total LEVA supply is allocated to the Fjord LBP in **Phase 1: Protocol Ignition**.  
These tokens are the only supply entering circulation at launch.

---

## 👥 How much does the founding/contributor team hold?

The **core contributor team** holds **15%** of total supply, subject to:

- A **12-month cliff**
- A **3-year linear vesting schedule**

These tokens are fully locked and cannot be sold or delegated during the cliff period.

---

## 🧱 How is the rest of the supply allocated?

Remaining tokens are reserved for:

- **Ecosystem incentives**
- **Schema validator rewards**
- **Protocol execution scaling**
- **Long-term registry maintenance**
- **Zero-governance treasury reserves**

There is **no pre-sale**, **no airdrop**, and **no community emissions**.

---

## 🧪 Are any tokens staked?

No. LEVA does not use staking or yield-bearing mechanisms.  
The only way to use a token is to **burn it** and trigger an execution.

---

## 🧾 How does the token accrue value?

Value accrues through **usage**, not speculation.  
Each time a LEVA token is burned:

- Supply is reduced  
- An output is produced  
- That output is logged, referenced, and priced

The more coordination occurs, the more tokens are consumed.  
There are **no passive functions, no governance voting rights, and no inflation offsets**.

---

## 💸 Was there a seed round?

No. LEVA has not raised any external funding.

---

## 🤝 Are there any VC allocations?

No. There are **no VCs, no angel investors, and no advisory token holders**.

The project is 100% founder-led.

---

## 🗓 What happens after the LBP?

Tokens sold in the LBP become immediately usable for execution.  
There are no lockups or vesting for public participants.

The capital raised will fund:

- Burn registry deployment  
- Smart contract audit  
- Agent registry activation  
- Execution UX delivery  
- Legal infrastructure  
- Core contributor operations

---

## 📊 What is the launch valuation?

Target FDV at launch is **€5–6 million** based on market comps, token utility, and underlying infrastructure readiness.

---

LEVA’s token is not designed for trading, governance, or liquidity games.  
It is a coordination trigger — burned to execute strategy, and priced by consequence.
