# Schema Evolution & AI Readiness Activation History  
*(From Eleva OS to LEVA Protocol)*

From inception, the Eleva platform has executed **5,773 structured AI Readiness Reports**. Each report represents a complete multi-agent logic path triggered via schema-bound workflows. These activations directly shaped the agent structure, schema versioning, and burn registry design now formalised in the LEVA Protocol.

## Schema Evolution Timeline

Schema logic was versioned internally across multiple iterations — each introducing new decision logic, execution signal handling, and validator rules:

| Version | Improvements                                          |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| v1.0    | Manual prompt injection, basic 2-agent orchestration  |
| v1.4    | Introduced GTM Mapper and Fit Score logic             |
| v2.0    | Formalised schema validation and execution signal types |
| v2.5    | Added output versioning and webhook delivery preview  |

These schema versions governed every activation — ensuring consistent outputs and tracked logic flow across use cases. LEVA now codifies these patterns into a public, registry-indexed coordination protocol with cryptographic finality.

## Sample Schema Activations (Anonymised)

Below are anonymised summaries of full logic paths executed during AI Readiness Reports. Each example highlights schema logic, agent stack, and the type of strategic output produced.

### Example 1 – Early-Stage SaaS Founder (Ireland)

- **Agents Triggered:**  
  GTM Mapper → Investor Memo Synth → Ops Navigator  
- **Token Usage:** ~3,400  
- **Output:**  
  - GTM Fit Score: 72%  
  - Recommended Funding Window: Pre-seed  
  - Execution Signal: **HOLD** — Refine pricing and competitor framing

### Example 2 – Deep Tech Startup (Germany)

- **Agents Triggered:**  
  Positioning Mapper → IP Landscape → Funding Fit  
- **Token Usage:** ~4,800  
- **Output:**  
  - Clarity Score: 64%  
  - Market Entry Strategy: Dual-niche GTM suggested  
  - Burn-Readiness: **MEDIUM** — Schema flow not yet stable

### Example 3 – AI Legal Platform (UK)

- **Agents Triggered:**  
  Compliance Snapshot → Customer Logic Synth → Burn Fit  
- **Token Usage:** ~2,950  
- **Output:**  
  - Regulatory Readiness Score: 83%  
  - Suggested Revenue Model: Transactional > Subscription  
  - Execution Path: **CLEAR** — Eligible for burn onboarding

## Summary Metrics

- Reports Executed: **5,773**  
- Average Agents per Report: **4.3**  
- Total OpenAI Token Usage (Logged): **25,118,422**  
- Sector Spread: 20+ verticals (SaaS, fintech, AI infra, legaltech, B2B services)  
- Execution Model: **Off-chain, schema-bound orchestration (v1.0–v2.5)**

## Protocol Continuity

All schema logic, agent roles, and signal outputs used in these 5,773 activations are now embedded in LEVA's on-chain registry and execution framework. The LEVA burn protocol introduces public verifiability, registry-indexed agent flows, and permanent output linkage.

This foundation gives LEVA a uniquely mature architecture: it is not a speculative framework — it is a codification of real strategic execution logic, now made composable and irreversible through on-chain coordination.
